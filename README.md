This code uses pygame to create a spike jumping geometry dash type game creating a player and game state as well as establishing the game physics and mechanics for the character to jump over randomized spaced spikes that if collided with will result in death or game over. I used pygame.image.load to add in custom images for the background and character. There is also music and jump sounds and a score counter at the top.
